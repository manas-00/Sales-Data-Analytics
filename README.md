# Sales-Data-Analytics

## Project Description:
XYZ is a hardware company supplying devices to multiple stores across various regions. With a headquarters and several regional offices, the company is facing a challenge as sales are declining. To address this issue, the aim is to identify the reasons behind the declining sales and prepare a comprehensive dashboard to visualize and analyze the relevant data.

## AIMS Grid and Project Planning:

### Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to analyze sales data to understand the factors contributing to declining sales for XYZ's hardware devices. By uncovering insights through data analysis and visualization, the company aims to make informed decisions to improve sales performance.

### Stakeholders:
The stakeholders for this project include executives and managers at XYZ's headquarters and regional offices, sales teams, marketing teams, and finance departments. Additionally, external stakeholders such as investors and shareholders may also be interested in the findings and outcomes of this project.

### End Result:
The end result of this project is to create a comprehensive dashboard using Tableau that provides actionable insights into the factors influencing declining sales. The dashboard will enable stakeholders to visualize sales trends, identify patterns, and explore potential correlations with other variables such as marketing campaigns, product availability, and regional demographics.

### Success Criteria:
The success of this project will be evaluated based on several criteria, including:
Improvement in sales performance following the implementation of insights gained from the dashboard.
Increased understanding of sales trends and drivers among stakeholders.
Positive feedback from stakeholders on the usability and effectiveness of the Tableau dashboard.
Timely completion of project milestones, including data analysis, dashboard creation, and stakeholder feedback.

## Project Execution Steps:

### Create a Star Schema:
Design and implement a star schema data model to structure the sales data for efficient analysis. This involves identifying and defining fact tables (e.g., sales transactions) and dimension tables (e.g., products, stores, time).

### ETL (Extract, Transform, Load):
Perform data cleaning and modification tasks as part of the ETL process. This includes tasks such as removing sales values less than 1 (i.e., 0 and -1), converting currency values from USD to INR, and handling any missing or inconsistent data.

### Build Dashboard:
Utilize Tableau to build a dashboard that visualizes the sales data and key performance indicators (KPIs) relevant to the project objectives. Design the dashboard to be user-friendly, interactive, and capable of providing insights into sales trends, regional variations, product performance, and other relevant metrics.
By following these steps and leveraging Tableau's capabilities, XYZ aims to gain actionable insights into the factors influencing declining sales and drive strategic decision-making to improve sales performance.
